################### Packetbeat Configuration Example #########################

# This file contains an overview of various configuration settings. Please consult
# the docs at https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/packetbeat/current/_configuration.html
# for more details.

# The Packetbeat shipper works by sniffing the network traffic between your
# application components. It inserts meta-data about each transaction into
# Elasticsearch.

############################# Shipper ############################################
shipper:

 # The name of the shipper that publishes the network data. It can be used to group
 # all the transactions sent by a single shipper in the web interface.
 # If this options is not defined, the hostname is used.
 name:

 # The tags of the shipper are included in their own field with each
 # transaction published. Tags make it easy to group transactions by different
 # logical properties.
 #tags: ["service1"]

 # Uncomment the following if you want to ignore transactions created
 # by the server on which the shipper is installed. This option is useful
 # to remove duplicates if shippers are installed on multiple servers.
 # ignore_outgoing: true

############################# Sniffer ############################################

# Select the network interfaces to sniff the data. You can use the "any"
# keyword to sniff on all connected interfaces.
interfaces:
 device: "any"


############################# Protocols ######################################
protocols:
  
  
  http:

    # Configure the ports where to listen for HTTP traffic. You can disable
    # the http protocol by commenting the list of ports.
    ports: [9200]
    send_response: false
    send_request: true
 

############################# Output ############################################

# Configure what outputs to use when sending the data collected by packetbeat.
# You can enable one or multiple outputs by setting enabled option to true.

  console:
    pretty: true
